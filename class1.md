# Concepts in Machine Learning Class 1

## Objectives
Welcome to Concepts in Machine learning from fredhutch.io!
This course will introduce you to some key concepts and common terms in the field of machine learning. The goal being that students who finish this course have an understanding of core concepts behind the technical aspects of actually implementing machine learning methods. This course covers material that is pre-requisite to taking the Machine Learning in R and Machine Learning in Python courses also offered through fredhutch.io.

By the end of this session you should:
- Have working definitions of what machine learning and data science are
	- understand their connection
- Recognize key paradigms and terms including
	- Supervised learning
	- Unsupervised learning
	- other terms??

## What is machine learning?
- include definitions of machine learning here
- think on TA cabinet analogy - how can we improve this/make clearer

## Experimental design and CRISP-DM
- Still need to find a good overview of CRISP-DM
- Make the connection that the experimental design of a machine learning project is very important to our interpretation of the data
- Remove references to 'business'? we're mainly speaking to researchers

## Machine learning paradigms:
- what is a paradigm
- supervised vs unsupervised
- supervised categorical problems and regression problems

## Importance of understanding data
