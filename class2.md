# Concepts in Machine Learning Class 2

## Objectives

- Review CRISP-DM and supervised vs unsupervised ml
- Understand the basic purpose of Loss functions for fitting and evaluating
- Understand bias and variance trade-off
	- Relate to concepts of signal and noise
- Understand regression vs classification
	- recognize common approaches for regression

## Review
- Pretty extensive. I wonder if we could condense this portion.

## Drosophila example
- Problem statements
- Things to consider w supervised learning
- walk our example through the scikit learn algo cheat sheet

## Issues with data
- go over importance of cleaning/imputing/transforming
- provide some examples
- talk about issues with not having enough data

## Linear Regression

## Ordinary Least Squares

## Loss functions/Evaluation metrics

## Bias-variance trade off
- overfitting and underfitting

## Introduce next weeks topic - random forests
