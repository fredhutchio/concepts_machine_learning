# Concepts in Machine Learning Course

This course consists of four one hour classes and covers the basic concepts of classical machine learning (supervised and unsupervised methods). This course is meant to be an introduction and overview to machine learning and does not include any code or statistics. 

**There are no prerequisites to this course.**

**This course is a prerequisite to Machine Learning in Python and R.**

By the end of this course you should be able to:

* Identify questions that are and are not appropriate applications of machine learning
* Understand the importance of exploratory data analysis, experimental design, and data collection to applying machine learning algorithms
* Recognize the four main paradigms of machine learning
* Differentiate between supervised and unsupervised ML methods and applications
* Recognize and have a basic understanding of common approaches to supervised (regression, classification) and unsupervised (clustering, dimensionality reduction) machine learning.
